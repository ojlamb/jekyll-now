I am a Software Engineer and Product Manager. My interests and expertise revolve around geospatial technology, data visualization, mapping, and analysis. I currently work at [RedZone Software](http://www.redzone.co/) in Boulder, CO where I lead product and development efforts.

In 2015 I attended [Makers Academy](https://makersacademy.com/) to learn how to build software.

In 2013 graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelors Degree in Geography. My Studies focused on Geographic Information Science and Web Mapping.

In the Summer of 2012 I interned at [esri](https://esri.com/) and worked on the first version of ArcGIS Online.

I reside in Denver, CO with my fianc√© Alex and dog Jerry.
