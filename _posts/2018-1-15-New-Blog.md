This year I hope to write more. There is a lot of exciting things going on and I want to use this space to keep track of everything.

As we kick off 2018, I wanted to state some of my goals - both personal and professional.

This year I am am to starting a [consulting]("http://ojlamb.com/consulting") business (part-time for now). I've been working in the GIS and Web-mapping space for over 5 years now. There is need for well designed mapping solutions as location data becomes larger, more complex, and ubiquitous. I have experience building and scaling these solutions and believe I can aid other organizations facing similar problems.

I am also going to: 
* Plan a huge, kickass wedding in Medell√≠n, Colombia!
* Learn spanish.
* Continue my fitness routine with [Genfit Denver]("http://www.genfitdenver.com/") and compete in a rowing competition on team Genfit.
